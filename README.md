# EverReign

EverReign is a top down, 2-D, rpg, meant to be played similiar to classic zelda games of past. 
Your character can move via arrow keys or WASD, whatever you perfer. In future, card building mechanic will be incorporated allowing a character to build a "deck" of sorts, using magic, different card combos, and stratgey to traverse the world and solve puzzles. 

# Personal Overview
I am creating this game as a love letter to the games that have inspired me to learn about the world of computers, with a desire that other people can experience similair adventures I had growing up as well. To me, video games are an underappreciated art form, one I wish to learn more of and add my own personality to. This is something I hope to leave as a legacy to who I am today. 

### Here are several YouTube demos showcasing the game. Watch it grow in real time!

# Development Environment
Currently Godot is being used to code my first game, "baby's first game engine" if you will. I am using GDScript as the main language, I have a few libraries I want to incorporate, but I'm going at a really slow pace so that might be awhile. 

# Future Improvements!
* Stop the camera glitches. It is driving me insane!
* Transportation between worlds
* Interactive villagers
* destroyable bushes
* enemies
